# Object Pages System

A minimalist personal knowledge management and productivity system that gives every thought its own dedicated space.

## What is this repository?

This repository contains my official documentation and resources for implementing the Object Pages System - a paper-based organizational method I designed to reduce cognitive load and increase clarity through thoughtful separation of ideas.

## Latest Updates

Version 2.0 introduces several enhancements to the original system:

- Added three new object types (Connection, Decision, and Reference)
- Enhanced organization system with clearer status tracking
- Improved navigation with edge indexing and temporal references
- Added detailed workflow guides for daily implementation
- Expanded digital archiving recommendations
