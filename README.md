# Object Pages System

A minimalist personal knowledge management and productivity system that gives every thought its own dedicated space.

## What is this repository?

This repository contains my official documentation and resources for implementing the Object Pages System - a paper-based organizational method I designed to reduce cognitive load and increase clarity through thoughtful separation of ideas.

## Repository Contents

- **[Documentation](docs/)**: Comprehensive guides on implementation and usage
- **[Templates](templates/)**: Printable templates for each object type
- **[Examples](examples/)**: Sample filled-out pages to reference
- **[Scripts](scripts/)**: Utilities for digital archiving and integration
- **[CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)**: Version history and updates

## Quick Start Guide

1. Read the [Core Concepts](docs/core-concepts.md) document to understand the foundational principles
2. Print the [Quick Reference Guide](docs/quick-reference.md) for a one-page system overview
3. Choose your preferred [templates](templates/) based on your needs
4. Review [examples](examples/) to see the system in action
